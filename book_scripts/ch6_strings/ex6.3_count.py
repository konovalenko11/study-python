    Exercise 6.3

        Encapsulate this code in a function named count,
        and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

    Exercise 6.4

        There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise.
        Read the documentation of this method at https:// docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods and
        write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in 'banana'.

    Exercise 6.5

        Take the following Python code that stores a string:â€˜

    str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'

"""


def char_count(data_string, find_char):
    char_matches: int = 0

    for char in data_string:
        if char == find_char:
            char_matches += 1

    return char_matches
